### Protocol NMEA
 NMEA consists of sentences, the first word of which, called a data type, defines the interpretation of the rest of the sentence. 
 There are many sentences in the NMEA standard for all kinds of devices that may be used in a Marine environment. Someones are this:
 - GPRMC (Recommended Minimum data) // (at the moment this is implemented.)
 - GPGGA (Global positioning system fix data)
 - GPGSA (GNSS DOP and Active Satellites)
 - GPGLL (Latitude and longitude, with time of position fix and status)
